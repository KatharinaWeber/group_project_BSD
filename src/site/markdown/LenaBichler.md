## Individual Workload
    Name: lena Bichler

As seen in the Readme, we divided the workload between ourselves. I did these following parts:
- branch readme and the README.md
- developer Information in maven_detail
- bug_hunt with Katharina Weber
- branch drink
- both did branch queue
- branch tests with testing done by both
- in maven_site adding my Markdown
