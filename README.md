- **Branches:**
    - `main`: Main branch containing stable code.
    - `maven`: Maven setup and initial project structure.
    - `readme`: Markdown README file creation and task planning.
    - `maven_detail`: Detailed Maven configuration and dependencies.
    - `bug_hunt`: Bug fixing in existing code.
    - `drink`: Implementation of Cocktail class.
    - `queue`: Implementation of DrinkQueue class.
    - `javadoc`: JavaDoc comments for code documentation.
    - `tests`: Unit tests for code coverage.
    - `maven_site`: Maven site documentation setup.
